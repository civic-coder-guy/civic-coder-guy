### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python. (Taking the 100 Days of Code: The Compete Python Pro Bootcamp with App Brewery on Udem.)
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning to create a PyGame while using Code this Game! book by Meg Ray.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on teaching my kids how to create a webpage using the book Get Coding! by Young Rewired State.

âš¡ Fun fact: I retire from the U.S. Army in July 2023!
Great Tools and Resources<br>
